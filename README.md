# Promineo-Tech-Final

This is the final project from Promineo Tech and was worked in a group project. The projects theme was shoe sales and the basics behind building the project. The project involves implemention a restful webAPI and full CRUD operations for each of the entities that were created, and was done on a MySQL database named shoes. 

The project also included the modification of the API documentation in the controller interface to create the correct responses for each of the operations done throught the entities.
